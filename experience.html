        <h2>My Experience</h2>
        <p class="Paragraphs">From an early age I have always enjoyed working on computers. I remember back in the 
          mid 90s the first time hearing about webpages and thinking they would be just like pages of a book. Little 
          did I know at the time that I would develop a love for the Internet. This love has continued to grow and I 
          would have an opportunity to design and create my own websites.</p>

        <p class="Paragraphs">My first experience of being able to manipulate and format data was in Microsoft Excel 
          by changing to color of a cell depending on what information was showing. The sense of achievement and 
          feeling I got made me a little addicted and wanting to format every cell even if not needed.
        </p>

        <p class="Paragraphs">After leaving school I went to university as it was perceived that in order to get a 
          good job your needed a degree. At the age of 21 I hade no idea what I wanted to do for a career and picked 
          a degree based on my summer job working in France. When choosing a degree I did consider a computer science
          degree however I was under the impression that you had to be a genius in order to work with computers. Due 
          to this myth I was feeling discouraged however after watching a few Youtube videos I felt I needed 
          to take the plunge as that burning desire and enjoyment to work with computers was still there. </p>  
        
        <p class="Paragraphs">It has long been known that the half the jobs people do can theoretically be automated.  
          As a result coming from a customer service background I feel it is important to for me to update my skills to ensure I remain relevant in the market
          place and follow my heart.</p>

        <p class="Paragraphs">Due to all these factors I have now decided to do a <a class="treehouse" href="https://join.teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/" target="_blank">
          Team Treehouse Techdegree.</a> which in the future I believe along with a lot of hard work will support me
